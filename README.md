# Expandable Layout

Hello everyone, I am here with my new extension that is Expandable View. This extension helps you to expand or collapse the view with some customisations. This is based on the Expandable Layout 16 published in Github. This extension does not increase or decrease the height or width of the layout as my Expand Collapse View 16 do. This extension expand or collapse the view with animations API that don’t modify height or width of the component. When we modify the height or width of the component that their child components are much effected. This extension don’t affect them and works like professional.
